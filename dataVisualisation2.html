        <h1>International Students Enrolment</h1>
        <p>the number of international students around the world was <b>steadily increasing</b>.

        </div>
        <p>In a comprehensive study conducted by researchers, data were collected from <b>international students</b> studying in <b>Germany</b> and the <b>United Kingdom (UK)</b>. The qualitative phase of this research identified six pivotal themes: <b>academic</b>, <b>social</b>, <b>personal</b>, <b>financial</b>, <b>career</b>, and <b>marketing</b>, which heavily influence students' decisions to study abroad. These findings align with the factors categorized in a questionnaire-based study by <b>Abbas et al. (2021)</b>. Empirical analyses revealed that students in both countries prioritize <b>academic reputation</b> when selecting a country for <b>higher education institutions (HEIs)</b>. However, intriguing variations emerged in the subsequent themes. Furthermore, it was observed that <b>international students in Germany</b> exhibited a higher level of satisfaction with their choice of country compared to their counterparts in the <b>UK</b>. You can hover over each tile in <b>Abbas et al.'s research</b> to view the <b>percentage</b> of students who selected each specific factor.</p>

Number of students are not as much compared to pre-covid era</p>
